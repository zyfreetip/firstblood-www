## Installing Node.js (if you don't have it)

If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the Node.js download page. If you're using Linux, you can use the <a href ="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">installer</a>, or you can check <a href = "https://github.com/nodesource/distributions">NodeSource's binary distributions</a> to see whether or not there's a more recent version that works with your system.
    
Test: Run `node -v`. <br>
The version should be higher than `v0.10.32`.

## Updating npm

Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. <br>However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.<br>

    $ npm install npm@latest -g

# Install & Test Locally
