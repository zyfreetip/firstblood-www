															Witness nodes are the curators of matches. They serve as the final gateway before matches and rewards are processed. The network of Witness nodes act as a decentralized proxy that has the ability to connect to game APIs and cross-reference game outcomes to ensure no false, fraudulent, or suspicious matches are being processed by the platform.
