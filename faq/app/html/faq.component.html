												<div class="cd-faq-content">
													<p>
												    During our crowdsale you can directly convert Ether into tokens through a transaction to the smart contract. We will provide a simple app that you can use through your web browser, Mist Browser, or MetaMask, to send the transaction to the smart contract. We are also working on partnerships with exchanges that will support our crowdsale.

												<div class="cd-faq-content">
													<p>
														Yes. If either the Witnesses are unable to verify the game result through the API, or the participants report different game outcomes, then the match will automatically go to the Jury Voting Pool. If one player reports a loss and the other reports a win and the reports match the game result, the prize will be paid out to the rightful winner. If there is an inconsistency or dispute, Witnesses will not be able to verify the outcome and the dispute will move to the Jury Voting Portal.

															Witness nodes are the curators of matches. They serve as the final gateway before matches and rewards are processed. The network of Witness nodes act as a decentralized proxy that has the ability to connect to game APIs and cross-reference game outcomes to ensure no false, fraudulent, or suspicious matches are being processed by the platform.

                              No. FirstBlood is a skill-based wagering platform that only allows you to bet on yourself during a match. However, feel free to organize tournaments with your friends once we enable that feature!
